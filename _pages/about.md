Welcome to my website!

I work in Machine Learning at [PathAI](https://pathai.com) developing deep learning technology for digital pathology. Previously I was an MS CS student specializing in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://khoury.northeastern.edu/), advised by [Dr. Rose Yu](http://roseyu.com/). I have spent some time as a research intern at [PathAI](https://pathai.com) (Summer 2020) and [Apprentice Health](https://apprenticehealth.com) (2019) where I applied machine learning to solving challenging problems in healthcare and improving patient outcomes.

**Research Interests**:
My current skills lie in machine learning applied to digital pathology and I find myself excited about self-supervised, multi-modal, and multi-task learning. I am generally interested in optimization and deep learning.

**Previously**: I began my career as a software engineer at [Media.net](https://media.net) (part of the [Directi](https://directi.com) group). My focus was on developing large-scale, low-latency solutions to optimize ad revenue in the ad-tech industry. As I progressed within the organization, I eventually became a senior software engineer leading a team of five, which provided me with valuable leadership experience.


Topics that intrigue me include but are not limited to networks, finance, entrepreneurship, music, spirituality, and just about anything else that helps me understand why the world is the way it is.
